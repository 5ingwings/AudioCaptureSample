# AudioCaptureSample

Sample app for Android 10's AudioPlaybackCapture API, which allows applications to capture the audio of other applications.

This app serves as a showcase for how to request the proper permissions and architect an application by using a foreground service that wraps the audio sample data capturing. You can also use it to ensure your application behaves properly when targetting API level 29 and above.
